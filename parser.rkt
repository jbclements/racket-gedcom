;; this parser is totally incomplete.

;; this parser is based on "GEDCOM 5.5.1 AE Revision 2",
;; downloaded from https://www.gedcom.org/gedcom.html

;; it does successfully parse at least one GED file.

;; it uses racket regexps.

;; top-level notes on spec:
;; 1) it appears that underscore should be legal in any_char
;; 2) given the comments in the file, shouldn't \t be moved
;;    out of other_char and into any_char?

;; these could just be problems with FamilyTree's gedcom:
;; 1) The "DATE" tag appears with a trailing space but no value, which
;;    is technically illegal but not a big deal (e.g. "2 DATE ")
;; 2) as expected, at signs are used unquoted in many email addresses.
;; 3) tabs appear in many line_item's. Illegal, right?
;; 4) There's heavy use of pointers in free text, as in
;;    "2 CONT : Child:  @I123@". Looking at some of these, it looks like
;;    these are mostly quoting failures. Ouch.

;; level 2 notes, wikitree failures:
;; 1) tags like BIRT and DATE often appear
